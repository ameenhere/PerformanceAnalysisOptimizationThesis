Raw data from my research work

The synthetic performance database based on DHIS2 version 2.34 can be downloaded from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yd6FhO6X0Yuk-j8v6sqm0bkrfSw026Ka/view?usp=sharing 

The corresponding DHIS2 war file can be downloaded from https://releases.dhis2.org/ . Adding specific version download URLs below.

Unoptimized 2.35.0 can be downloaded from https://releases.dhis2.org/2.35/dhis2-stable-2.35.0.war

Optimized 2.35.8 can be downloaded from https://releases.dhis2.org/2.35/dhis2-stable-2.35.8.war

These war files can be used to compare the different query optimizations done during my research work.
